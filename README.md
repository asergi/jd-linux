jd-linux
========

**jd-linux** is a bundle that provides everything you need to:

* install/uninstall JDownloader on Linux easily;
* make it fit seamlessly into all the major DEs (GNOME, KDE, Xfce, LXDE).

The package contains: a Makefile, a dektop file, icons, a XML file that adds
mime-type support for encrypted link-containers, like CCF, RSDF and DLC files
and a script, which will download and launch the latest stable JDownloader.
The downloaded files will be stored in ~/.jdownloader by default.

jd-linux is derived from the JDownloader Ubuntu package: https://launchpad.net/~jd-team/+archive/jdownloader
